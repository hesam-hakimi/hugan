TASK_ID: ETL-0910-EXISTING-CONSUMER-UPGRADE-INDEPENDENT-REVIEW01
TYPE: Independent read-only review of the completed installed upgrade smoke.

Review:
ETL-0910-INSTALLED-WORKFLOW-EXISTING-CONSUMER-UPGRADE-SMOKE01

Goal
Determine whether the retained evidence supports delivery of the
etl-validate-write managed asset from 1.1.4 to 1.1.5 in the existing
Autonomous Guarded consumer workspace, with the claimed preservation
and approval behavior.

Use English for all outputs.

Scope
Resolve the exact task bundle and predecessor acceptance from local
records. Use recorded paths and recompute hashes from actual files;
do not transcribe hashes from photographs. Preserve all original records.

Review these claims:
1. The installed extension and selected consumer match the recorded
   baseline. Distinguish extension version 0.3.147 from managed asset
   version 1.1.5.
2. Pre-upgrade Audit identified exactly one stale asset. Independently
   check that the expected target was derived from the installed catalog
   and frozen before approval, rather than copied from the final output.
3. Pending and Cancel inventories support zero changes. Correlate the
   retained DOM transitions, timestamps, inventories and actual button
   selection. Inspect retained screenshots where supported; state any
   visual-review limitation.
4. Exactly one Upgrade Managed Assets operation changed the target.
   Overwrite and Repair were not executed.
5. The resulting file matches the independently checked expectation,
   has valid managed metadata/checksum and the Target Root guidance.
   Verify that the other 20 assets and .gitignore remained unchanged.
6. Post-upgrade Audit reports 21 current assets and no stale assets.
   Do not describe this as a second upgrade.
7. Review N1–N5 independently. Separate acceptance of this observed
   one-file upgrade from unresolved disclosure and destructive-action
   UI issues. Explain the trailing-newline change and retain the limit
   that non-empty user content outside the managed block was untested.
8. Inspect launch arguments, including --disable-workspace-trust,
   against the task's actual authorization. Report any deviation and
   qualification limit; do not infer normal workspace-trust behavior
   or rerun the Host to compensate.
9. Preserve the distinct historical FIX01 and PARITY01 test results.
   Do not merge their counts or claim the adjacent suite is green.

Boundaries
No Host launch, model request, ETL tool invocation, build, test run,
packaging, installation, source edit, Git mutation, consumer write,
Repair, Overwrite, deployment or release.
Reuse existing evidence and helpers where useful. Do not create another
JS/PowerShell test framework or modify existing evidence.

Deliver only a concise report.md and valid result.json in a new review
directory. Include:
- Review verdict and evidence supporting it.
- Blocking findings, non-blocking findings and retained limitations.
- Whether this specific existing-consumer upgrade is accepted.
- Original job/env write correctness: not established by this review.
- Post-upgrade skill invocation: not established by this review.
- Release acceptance: not granted.
- One smallest justified next task.

Keep consumer resource-layout and broader agent/skill completeness
follow-ups open. Do not start the next task automatically.
